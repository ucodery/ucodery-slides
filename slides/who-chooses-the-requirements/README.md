# Who Chooses the Requirements

### Summary
All modern software is the composition of independently developed projects.
As a programmer you have some duty to record the relationship your project has to other projects in order to build and run correctly.

It is tempting to think that you, the software author, or you the package maintainer, are in full control over what those requirements are, but you are not.
This misunderstanding is the source of many errors. And when authors do discover this but instead of accept it they make a power grab, all they really do is contribute to "dependency hell".

Don't add to dependency hell, add to the users' success and learn to live with less control.
